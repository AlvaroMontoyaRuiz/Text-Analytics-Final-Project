You \nwere admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely \nthat this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from \nyour cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid \nwas removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to \nhave a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came \ndown with treatment but this should continue to be followed as \nan outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a \nrepresentative from hospice. Because of your repeated \nparacenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex \ncatheter placement.

CT scan from \nthat hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The \nRhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued \nprior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal \nspray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. \n\n#NSTEMI\nPatient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This \nwas trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component \ndowntrended during course of admission. The patient was without \nchest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted \nwho thought that this was most likely secondary to demand \nischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram \ndemonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based \non wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was \nuptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his \nclopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.\n\n#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation\nPatient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he \nmaintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied \nshortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious \nsymptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation \nin left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. \n-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered \nwith antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for \nthe Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.\n\n#Acute kidney injury\nPatient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at \nPCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The \npatient was discharged with a stable creatinine.\n\n#Peripheral vascular disease\nPatient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of \nMI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral \nstents.

The tumor cells \nare positive for CK20 and CDX-2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1. \n These results are consistent with metastasis from a colorectal \nprimary.\n\nImaging:\nEKG (___):\nSinus tachycardia. Low voltage. Diffuse non-specific \nrepolarization\nabnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ \nrepolarization\nabnormalities are slightly more prominent.\n___\n___\n\nPortable CXR (___):\nInnumerable pulmonary metastases.  Possible mild pulmonary \nvascular\ncongestion.  Low lung volumes.\n\nCTA (___):\n1.  No central or segmental filling defect in the pulmonary \narteries.\nEvaluation is slightly limited due to suboptimal IV bolus. \n2.  Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, simas seen on the \nprior CT study on ___, slightly increased.  No focal \nconsolidation or pleural effusion.  \n3.  Enlarged liver with multiple hypodense lesions, with \nsuggestion of\nincreased burden of disease.\n\nRight upper quadrant ultrasound (___):\nExtensive diffuse hepatic metastatic disease.  No evidence of \nbiliary duct\nobstruction.\n\nPortable CXR (___):\n1. Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is \nunchanged. \n2. New small right fissural pleural effusion.\n3. No new focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.  \n\nNoncontrast head CT (___):\nNo acute intracranial process.  No mass is identified.  MRI is \nmore sensitive for evaluation of metastases.\n\nLeft hip XR (___):\nNo definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to \nevaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.\n\nPortable abdomen (___):\nRadiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a \nnonobstructed\nbowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present \nin the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement \nof the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright \nview is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free \nintraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected \nclinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would \nbe recommended.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, \nincluding lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially \npresented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening \nintrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous \nliver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon \ncancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and \neventually discharged home with hospice.\n\nActive Issues:\n(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary \nembolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission \ndemonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic \ncancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which \nhad evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient \nreluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy \nultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following \ndiscussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was \ntransferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential \ntrial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional \nand nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with \nthe patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus \ngoals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient \nwas discharged home with home hospice. \n\n(2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to \nhave focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse \nspinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of \npreserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted \nto be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying \nmalignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord \ninvolvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural \nabscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic \ncoverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite \nfrequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at \nlumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing \nclaustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.\n\n(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain \nand tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for \nobstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, \nparticularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. \nWhile multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen \nwas planned to evaluate for alternative sources of \nintraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple \noccasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol \nas needed.\n\n(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small \nvolume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with \nblood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit \nremained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for \ngastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of \nPPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was \ntrue blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. \nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of \nrecurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. \n\n(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered \nthroughout admission, never oriented to more than person and \nplace, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as \ncompared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including \nblood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent \nCXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for \nacute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion \nof metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI \naversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. \nHistory of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible \ncontributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. \nHepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic \nlesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ \nto severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained \nstable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.\n\n(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset \nshortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was \nnegative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could \nnot be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal \ninfiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against \nacute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent \nwith prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. \nShortness of breath resolved over the course of admission \nwithout dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers \nand expectorants as needed.\n\n(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked \nat 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting \nunderlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up \nincluding CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was \nunrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of \nisolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. \n\n(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ \nto ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin \n2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. \nRight upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis \nor obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed \nintraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded \nin the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she \ndeclined CT for further evaluation.\n\n(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout \nadmission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting \ncompromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant \ninfiltration. \n\n(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic \n100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO \nintake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. \nTachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite \nconcurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear \ninfectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental \npulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of \nadmission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she \nwas never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\n(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and \nseeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying \ndepression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and \ntreatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal \nideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly \nprior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held \npreprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was \nseen by social work throughout admission.\n\n(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and \nconsistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout \nadmission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the \nbasis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with \nthe exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active \nbleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.\n\n(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect \nsynthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of \nmalignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-Patient discharge home with home hospice\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

As you know, you were \nadmitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying \ncancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in \nthe blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath \nresolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh \nand abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further \ninvestigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your \nliver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver \nand lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were \ntransferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately \nchemotherapy would do more harm for you than good.  After a long \ndiscussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided \nthat you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.  We \nwill also set up hospice services for you so that they can help \nwith any issues that arise while you are at home.  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 400 \nmilliseconds. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave \nabnormalities extending to lead V6. Consider prior anterior \nmyocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of ___ \natrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is \nshorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  \n \nCXR ___:\nPA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. \nTiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No \nsigns of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is \ntop normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly \ntortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There \nis no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged \nupper abdomen is unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.\n\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity \nsize and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF \n>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are \nnormal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch \nlevels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nstructurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of \nmild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic \npulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting \npulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular \ncavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular \nsystolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate \nmitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nseverity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and \nmoderate PA hypertension is now identified.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes \nmellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, \nstage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and \nDOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. \nThe patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has \nbeen noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to \nthe floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. \nShe has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is \ncontributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand \nmyonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated \ntroponin.\n\n# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, \npatient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. \nHer only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs \nattributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin \nfell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting \nof renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to \nsuggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. \nShe was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for \nevidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to \n81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her \nLDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from \nsimvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues \nwith drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover \natorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at \ndischarge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that \nPlavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted \nand wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR \nin the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.\n  \n# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current \npresentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral \npleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE \nshowed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid \nregurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We \nchanged her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication \ncan be uptitrated as needed.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed \nwith our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended \nstaying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication \nnon-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, \nand ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added \nlisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued \nnifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her \nrenal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to \nbradycardia.

However, given right hilar \nfullness, a mass resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia is \nwithin the \ndifferential.  Recommend chest CT with intravenous contrast for \nfurther \nassessment. \n\nTTE: ___\nThe left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild \nto moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with \nnear-akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal lateral \nsegments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = \n35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are \nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but \naortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet \nof moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There \nis moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no \npericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. \nModerate pulmonary hypertension.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nregional LV wall motion abnormalities are new. Severity of \nmitral regurgitation has increased.\n\nCARDIAC CATH: ___\n1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system \nrevealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no \nobstructive disease.  The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid \nartery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion.  The \nLcx had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally occluded \nmid-vessel. \n  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Recommend CABG evaluation\n\nCT CHEST: ___\n1.  Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in \nthe right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent \nresidual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of \ndirection of jet in mitral \nregurgitation.  \n2.  Possible pulmonary hypertension. \n3.  Moderate coronary artery disease. \n\nCAROTID US: ___\nNo evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid \nstenosis on either side. \n\nECHO ___- PCI)\nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No \nmasses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no \nventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and \nfree wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe LVEF has increased. The degree of MR seen has decreased. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with \nincreased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or \nelevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern \nfor pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme \nleak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent \ncardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, \nlactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary \nedema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who \ntransferred the patient to cardiology floor.\n\n# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: \nLikely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in \nworsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior \nwall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac \ncath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically \nwith lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was \nconsulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. \nHowever, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high \nrisk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made \nto revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient \nwould regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a \nbare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in \nthe diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her \nmitral regurgitation. \n\n# NSTEMI/CAD:\nAs evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was \nbriefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac \ncatheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed \n3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with \naspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As \nthe patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to \nthe cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will \nrequire plavix for at least 1 month.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued \nnifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. \nShe was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.\n\n# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. \n \n# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently \nat baseline. \n\n# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. \n\n# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be \nscheduled to follow up with the first available CMED \ncardiologist. \n* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal \nstent placement = ___.\n* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her \ninsurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month).\n* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still \nhypertensive. \n* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ \nsecondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

As you recall, you were admitted for shortness \nof breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, \nwhich caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve \nwas weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart \narteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac \ncatheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your \nvalve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are \nglad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every \nmorning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs \nover 24 hours.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

A 4-mm calcified granuloma in the \nright lung base is unchanged. Limited images of the heart are \nunremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIn the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal \nglands, pancreas, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small \nand large bowel are unremarkable. There is no mesenteric \nlymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the \nabdomen. Immediately adjacent to the left common iliac artery, \nis a linear focus of hyper-attenuating material, with the \nappearance of suture material, largely unchanged from the prior \nexamination.\n\nIn the pelvis, suture material is seen in the distal sigmoid \ncolon, unchanged in appearance from prior examination and \nconsistent with colonic anastomosis. There is no evidence of \nstricture or obstruction at this site. There is no local fluid \ncollection to indicate abscess. There are no signs of \ninflammation. The intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are \nunremarkable, containing air and stool in a normal pattern \nwithout bowel dilatation. The appendix is visualized and is \nnormal.

Additionally, a small \nfocus of fluid attenuating material now extends from the \nabdominal wall musculature through the subcutaneous tissues, and \nappears to drain into an external collecting device. No discrete \nfluid collection is identified to indicate abscess formation, or \nthat would be amenable to drainage. However, this appearance \nsuggests continued cellulitis.\n\nExamination of osseous structures reveals mild degenerative \ndisease at L5-S1 and are otherwise unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.

Near complete collapse of the patient is originally drained \ncollection in the mid pelvis, with pigtail catheter in place. \n3.  Left lower quadrant and deep pelvic collections as above.  \nThese findings were discussed with the team.  Given the \npatient's improving clinical status, the decision was made to \npursue no further collection drainage at this time. \n4.  Severe bilateral hydronephrosis, as on prior examinations. \nRECOMMENDATION:  Given persistence of severe hydronephrosis, \npercutaneous \nnephrostomy tubes should be considered. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF SUMMARY:\n==============\n___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p \ncystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose \npost operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and \npelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with \nsubjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was \nfound to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC \nwith appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also \nfound on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a \nleft abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a \ndrain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, \nnegative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary \nfluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid \ncollection was completely drained. The prior drain was still \ndraining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. \nID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid \ncollections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned \nfrom broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require \nmultiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional \nissues. \n \nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior \ndrain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis \nrevealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made \nto place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant \ncells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that \nfluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid \nculture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new \nenlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the \ndrain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that \nalready had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it \ncontinued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than \nprior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid \ncollection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N \ncultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back \npositive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue \nintra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH \nand a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics \nwith vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV \nzosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately \n4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid \ncollection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. \n___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. \n\n#Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being \ndiagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox.  She \nwas transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and \nwas transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight \ndosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. \n\n#Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a \nbaseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely \n___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ \nresolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. \n\n\n#Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging \nfrom prior studies.

Facial numbness.  As this episode preceeded a headache, \nsuspect likely due to a migraine equivalent, however episode \ncould also be due to a TIA in the thalamus.  The patient had an \nMRI, which showed no signs of ischemia, and normal vasculature, \nmaking migraine equivalent a much more likely diagnosis.  \nHowever, given the possibility of TIA, she has been started on a \ndaily aspirin for future stroke prophylaxis.

An \nextra-axial hematoma, which would be subacute to chronic, is \nconsidered less likely. \n2. Loss of gray-white differentiation in the high left \nfrontoparietal lobe, could reflect an acute infarct. \n\nMRI Head ___:\nAcute to subacute bilateral infarctions with the largest focus \nin the left post-central gyrus. Appearance of the post-gyrus \nlesion is somewhat \nheterogeneous however and recommend attention on followup \nimaging for further evaluation to exclude the presence of an \nunderlying mass. Two meningiomas in the left frontal region \nwithout significant mass effect.\n\nECHO ___:\nMarked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity \nsize and regional/global systolic function. Mild aortic valve \nstenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Right ventricular free wall \nhypertrophy. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated \nascending aorta. \nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \nThe patient has mild aortic stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA \nValvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is \nsuggested in ___ years. \nBased on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the \necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical \ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on \nclinical and echocardiographic data. \n\nMRA Head/Neck ___:\nMild atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery. There is no \nevidence of acute vascular abnormalities involving the \nintracranial arteries \n\n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ was admitted to the neurosurgical service on ___ \nfrom the emergency room after having a series of falls on \n___. A CT of the head demonstrated a left frontal \nextra-axial mass as well as a more acute lesion in the parietal \nlobe on the left. Because of his recent falls, his coumadin was \nheld and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale as there was \nsome concern for hypoglycemia contributing to the unsteadiness. \n\nAn MRI of this head was obtained which confirmed a meningioma \noverlying the L frontal lobe and a sub-acute infarct in the \npost-central gyrus on the left. While he did have distinct right \nsided weakness in the emergency room, on hospital day #2 this \nweakness had nearly completely resolved and his confusion was \nalso better. A neurology consult was obtained given what \nappeared to be a sub-acute stroke on his MRI - they recommended \nrestarting the pt's coumadin, holding the dilantin and checking \nan EEG, these were done while he was an inpatient. He also \nunderwent a surface echo and an MRA of the brain and neck given \nthe likely embolic nature of his strokes. \n\nNeurology will see him in 3 months with a repeat head MRI. \n___ also saw him for his diabetes managment \nand recommended changing his glipizide to 10 BID, and not \nstarting insulin. His sugars were well controlled while in house \nand he did not have any episodes of hypoglycemia. From a \nneurologic standpoing, in-house he did quite well with resultion \nof his right sided weakness although his unsteadiness continued \nand he needed support while ambulating. \n\n___ recommended he go to a short term rehab until he was better \nable to compete transfers and ambulate with a walker. He will \nfollow up with neurology and neurosurgery to discuss how to best \nmanage his ischemic strokes and address the meningioma, \nrespectively.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCoumadin 2.5', prandin 0.5''', glipizide 5'', isosorbide \ndinitrate 10'', lisinopril 20, allopurinol ___, torsemide 5, \nmetoprolol 50''', lipitor 10'\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code.

She initially presented to ___ in ___ with abdominal \npain and failure to thrive. Evaluation at that time included an \nabdominal CT scan that showed multiple lung and liver \nmetastases. She has yet to undergo definite diagnosis with \nbiopsy, and per recent oncology documentation seems disengaged \nwith care.  \nShe was reportedly in her usual state of health until the \nevening prior to admission, when she developed acute on chronic \nshortness of breath while at rest. She reported midsternal chest \nache associated with this shortness of breath. Pain is \nexacerbated by direct pressure; nothing seems to alleviate pain. \nShe denied any pleuritic or exertional component to the chest \npain or shortness of breath. She feels that symptoms are \nsecondary to her \"cancer\" and \"feels as if the cancer has \nspread\". She reports stable, chronic nonproductive cough, which \nhas been present over the preceding months.  \nShe was seen recently in the ED for evaluation of left greater \nthan right lower extremity edema with lower extremity venous \nultrasounds negative, without change in edema since since that \nvisit. She denies associated fever, chills, sweats, PND, \northopnea, or positional component to pain. \nIn the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.0 116 100/49 24 99% RA. \nLabs notable for leukocytosis to 17.9, hematocrit of 32, and \nlactate of 2.8. Urinalysis was positive, but with 19 epithelial \ncells. CTA was negative for central pulmonary embolus, focal \nconsolidation, or pleural effusion, though did reveal \ninnumerable pulmonary nodules, as well as enlarged liver with \nstable metastases. EKG was interpreted as sinus tachycardia and \nwas overall consistent with prior. Ceftriaxone/azithromycin were \ninitiated for possible pneumonia. Vital signs on  transfer were \nas follows: 97.9 107 100/60 22 100% RA.

MRI is \nmore sensitive for evaluation of metastases.\n\nLeft hip XR (___):\nNo definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to \nevaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.\n\nPortable abdomen (___):\nRadiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a \nnonobstructed\nbowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present \nin the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement \nof the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright \nview is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free \nintraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected \nclinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would \nbe recommended.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, \nincluding lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially \npresented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening \nintrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous \nliver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon \ncancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and \neventually discharged home with hospice.\n\nActive Issues:\n(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary \nembolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission \ndemonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic \ncancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which \nhad evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient \nreluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy \nultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following \ndiscussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was \ntransferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential \ntrial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional \nand nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with \nthe patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus \ngoals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient \nwas discharged home with home hospice. \n\n(2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to \nhave focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse \nspinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of \npreserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted \nto be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying \nmalignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord \ninvolvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural \nabscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic \ncoverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite \nfrequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at \nlumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing \nclaustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.\n\n(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain \nand tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for \nobstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, \nparticularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. \nWhile multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen \nwas planned to evaluate for alternative sources of \nintraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple \noccasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol \nas needed.\n\n(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small \nvolume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with \nblood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit \nremained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for \ngastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of \nPPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was \ntrue blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. \nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of \nrecurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. \n\n(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered \nthroughout admission, never oriented to more than person and \nplace, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as \ncompared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including \nblood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent \nCXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for \nacute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion \nof metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI \naversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. \nHistory of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible \ncontributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. \nHepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic \nlesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ \nto severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained \nstable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.\n\n(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset \nshortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was \nnegative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could \nnot be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal \ninfiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against \nacute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent \nwith prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. \nShortness of breath resolved over the course of admission \nwithout dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers \nand expectorants as needed.\n\n(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked \nat 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting \nunderlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up \nincluding CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was \nunrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of \nisolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. \n\n(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ \nto ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin \n2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. \nRight upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis \nor obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed \nintraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded \nin the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she \ndeclined CT for further evaluation.\n\n(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout \nadmission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting \ncompromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant \ninfiltration. \n\n(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic \n100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO \nintake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. \nTachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite \nconcurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear \ninfectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental \npulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of \nadmission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she \nwas never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\n(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and \nseeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying \ndepression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and \ntreatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal \nideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly \nprior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held \npreprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was \nseen by social work throughout admission.\n\n(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and \nconsistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout \nadmission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the \nbasis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with \nthe exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active \nbleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.\n\n(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect \nsynthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of \nmalignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-Patient discharge home with home hospice\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

As you know, you were \nadmitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying \ncancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in \nthe blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath \nresolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh \nand abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further \ninvestigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your \nliver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver \nand lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were \ntransferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately \nchemotherapy would do more harm for you than good.  After a long \ndiscussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided \nthat you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.  We \nwill also set up hospice services for you so that they can help \nwith any issues that arise while you are at home.  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process  \n2. ___: Exercise stress test  \nINTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of PAD and \n \nLBBB was referred to the lab from the ER following negative \nserial  \ncardiac markers for evaluation of chest discomfort. The patient \nwas  \nreferred for a dipyridamole stress test but due to her \ntheophylline  \ntherapy we were not able to proceed. Due to her frequent atrial \nectopy we chose not to give her dobutamine but had her walk on \nthe treadmill instead. She exercised for 3 minutes of a modified \n___ protocol and stopped due to leg claudication. The \nestimated peak MET capacity was 2.5 which represents a poor \nfunctional capacity for her age. No arm, neck, back or chest \ndiscomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study. The \nST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of \nthe baseline LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated \napbs, occasional atrial couplets and a 6 beat run of PSVT. Rare \nisolated vpbs were also noted. Resting mild systolic \nhypertension with a pprorpriate increase in BP with exercise and \nrecovery.  \nIMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST \nsegments at a high cardiac demand and poor functional capacity. \nNuclear report sent separately.  \n3. ___ CATH:  \nLMCA: short, no CAD. LAD: mild  \nfocal origin disease (20%) and mild proximal disease (30%). LCX: \n \nminimal luminal irregularities. RCA: 30%.  \n4. ECG ___: sinus rhythm with multiple PACs, left axis \ndeviation, old LBBB \n5. ECG ___: Likely atrial tachycardia. Left bundle-branch \nblock. Compared to the previous tracing atrial tachycardia has \nreplaced sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Left \nbundle-branch block was previously noted. \n6. ECHO ___: Conclusions  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure \nis ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There \nis considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular \nejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. \nTissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular \nfilling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic \nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left \nventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is \nno pericardial effusion. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nfrequent atrial ectopy is seen; biventricular function appears \nsimilar.   \n\nMicro: ___: Bcx pending\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBrief Hospital Course\n===========================================================\n___ PMH of CAD, PVD, and COPD presenting with recurrent \nnon-exertional substernal chest pain. The patient has a history \nof mild CAD but labs were significant for negative troponins and \nEKG was without ischemic changes. During her admission, she also \ndeveloped multiple episodes of atrial tachycardia (AFib vs. \nAflutter) and was started on Amiodarone for rate/rhythm control \nand Rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and kept on home dose of \nDiltiazem also for rate control. She did not have any episodes \nof chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once \natrial fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to \nfollow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest \npain which led to admission.\n\nAcute Issues:\n========================================================\n#Atrial Tachycardia: During admission pt had runs of wide \ncomplex tachyarrythmia, thought likely supraventricular in \norigin: rapid Atrial Fibrillation/ Flutter vs. atrial \ntachycardia, with abberancy (complexes with similar morphology \nto native LBBB). She was treated with Diltiazem and Amiodarone \nand had fewer episodes of tachycardia. EP team evaluated patient \nand recommended anticoagulation and outpatient follow up to \nconsider EP study and possible ablation of Atrial Flutter. \nPatient was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor, Amiodarone \n200mg twice daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. \nDiltiazem continued at home dose. Rivaroxaban added for \nanticoagulation. As per outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___, \nplavix was discontinued in light of addition of Rivaroxaban and \ninterest in avoiding triple therapy in this patient. Pt was \ngiven follow up appointments with Drs. ___. She was \nscheduled to see Dr. ___ EP evaluation in 2 months.\n\n#Chest pain: Pt presented with substernal chest pain that \noccurred at rest and was ruled out for MI with no troponin \nelevation or significant new ECG changes. Likely her chest pain \nwas related to periods of tachycardia, although while in the \nhospital the runs of atrial tachycardia did not reproduce chest \npain. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during \nhospitalization, so was discharged once atrial \nfibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up \nwith her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which \nled to admission.\n\n#Dry eyes: pt had erythema and pain of R eye, found to have dry \neyes per optholmology. Sent out with Artificial tears and \nerythromycin eye drops. Patient had follow up appointment \nalready scheduled with optholmology and was instructed to attend \nappointment.\n\nChronic Issues:\n=============================================================\n# COPD  Pt appeared to be at baseline respiratory status. She \nwas sent home with her home albuterol neb, albuterol inhaler, \nFluticasone nasal spray, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, \ntiotropium bromide nebs, and theophylline\n\n# PAD: \nAs above, we stopped Clopidogrel as patient is now on \nRivaroxaban and wanted to avoid triple therapy as per her \ncardiologist Dr. ___.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n==============================================================\n1. Patient was discharged on Amiodarone 200 mg po twice daily \nfor one week until ___ and then 200mg po daily thereafter \nuntil her EP appointment with Dr. ___ in approximately 2 months.\n2. Pt was discharged on Rivaroxaban 20 mg qpm with dinner\n3. Pt discharged with outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor with \nresults to be interpreted by Cardiologist.\n4. She presented with chest pain but did not have elevated \nbiomarkers or EKG changes concerning for myocardial damage. \nMoreover, pt remained asymptomatic during periods of \nsupraventricular tachycardia while she was hospitalized. Patient \nmay benefit from outpatient stress test if such symptoms return.\n5. On day of discharge, pt had significant R eye pain and \nredness, was evaluated by Optholmology, who felt that it was \njust dry eyes, treated with erythromycin drops and artifiical \ntears. Patient already has appt w/ Opthamology in 5 days which \nshe will need to attend.\n\nFull Code\nContact: CONTACT: ___ (husband) ___ ___ \n(daughter) ___ \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Since the rapid rate makes you at increased risk for \nstroke, you were started on a blood thinning medication called \nRivaroxaban which you will need to take every day. Our \nspecialized cardiologists who deal specifically with the \nelectrical rhythm of the heart evaluated you and felt that you \nwould benefit from a medication called amiodarone which was also \nstarted. You will need to follow up with them in their clinic \nregarding this abnormal rhythm. In the meantime, you were \noutfitted with a Holter monitor to record your heart rate at \nhome. It is very important that you follow up with Dr. ___ \nyour cardiologist.\n\nWe wish you all the best,\n\nSincerely,\nYour care team at ___\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

She presented to her PCP's office with \nworsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining \nof nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic \nshe was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the \nED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see \nbelow). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have \nwheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. \nShe was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg \nPO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from \n400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to \nher tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, \nalbuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was \nconsulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 \nmg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns \nfor QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was \n460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, \nand discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was \ndischarged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at \n10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as \nfollow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she \npreviously followed with, Dr. ___.

Her COPD exacerbation was the likely \nprecipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, \nparticularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in \nthe ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg \nq6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. \nHer amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was \ndecreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID.\n\n#Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic \nanemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron \n125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron \nwith a bowel regimen. Her H/H was stable throughout the \nhospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding.\n\nTransitional issues:\n- patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg \nevery 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by \npulmonology\n- patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and \npulmonary rehab.

She has a history of multiple recurrent COPD \nhospitalizations. According to Pulmonary, patient has severe \nCOPD based on her obstructive deficits on PFTs as well as her \nsevere symptoms even at rest, as well as her more frequent \nexacerbations and is likely approaching end-stage disease. We \ncontinued Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, standing nebulizers, and \ntheophylline. Pulmonary recommended additional budesonide \ninhalers to allow reduction of PO prednisone dose. Prednisone \ndose was increased back to 40mg (where patient was better) with \na plan for slow wean by 5mg every 2 weeks. Also, patient was \nstarted on chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation; \nafter discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed to stop \nazithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT the \nweek after discharge, with plan to restart azithromycin once Dr. \n___ is able to see the patient. Patient did not want to go to \npulmonary rehab. She was seen by Palliative Care who recommended \ninitiation of morphine liquid suspension as needed for shortness \nof breath.\n\n# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 \nfrom a baseline of 1.0. She likely had poor PO intake. \nCreatinine on discharge was 0.9.\n \nCHRONIC ISSUES:  \n==================  \n# Anxiety/Insomnia: We continued home lorazepam.\n \n# Atrial fibrillation: We continued diltiazem for rate control \nand apixaban for anticoagulation.  \n \n# Hypertension: We continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, \nand diltiazem.  \n \n# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ showed no evidence of \nsignificant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ showed EF > \n55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. We \ncontinued home aspirin and atorvastatin.\n \n# Anemia: We continued home iron supplements. \n\n***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:*** \n- Continue Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, and theophylline \n- Make sure patient receives standing nebulizers \n- Added additional budesonide inhalers to allow reduction of PO \nprednisone dose \n- Start chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation. \n(Patient was started on azithromycin in the hospital and QTc on \n___ was 472 ms. ___ discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed \nto stop azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT \nthe week after discharge, with the plan to restart azithromycin \nonce Dr. ___ is able to see the patient.)\n- Would recommend audiology testing at some point while patient \nis on chronic azithromycin\n- Continue supplemental oxygen for comfort\n- Follow up with Dr. ___ discharge \n- Continue Bactrim PPX (1 tab SS daily) given extended courses \nof steroids \n- Patient was discharged on prednisone 40 mg with plan for taper \nby 5mg every 2 weeks:\n Prednisone 40 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end \n___\n Prednisone 35 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end \n___\n Prednisone 30 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end \n___\n etc...\n# CONTACT: ___ (husband/HCP) ___ \n# CODE STATUS: Full confirmed \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
